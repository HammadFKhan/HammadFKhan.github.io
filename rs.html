        Much of my undergraduate work has revolved around designing and fabricating
        microenvironment
        to observe neuronal growth and communication. Particularly looking at how perturbations
        in
        various physical topographies effect calcium communication. So why start there? To
        begin,
        we
        need to first take a look at how the human brain develops and changes over time. It is
        no
        means a flat plane, rather the neocortex is filled with these "hills and valleys".
        Biological
        evolution has allowed our brains to attain a very large volume relative to surface area.
        Hilgetag and Barbas explain this very well. If we can model the finer topographical
        structures
        in the human cortex on a petri dish, then it stands that we can learn some of the
        factors
        that
        play a role in the morphology of cellular communication and subnetworks.

        So why am I, an electrical engineer, researching this? Well, currently there is a
        multitude
        of techniques that capture neuronal development and communication in vitro. However,
        systemically elucidating neuronal communication using a curvature confinement within a
        petri
        dish has not been done. How does different bending affect the way that cells signal each
        other? What about cellular growth? When I first joined Kunze Neuroengineering lab on the
        summer of my junior year, microfabricating devices provided an avenue of interest. My
        advisor,
        Dr. Anja Kunze, thought it would be a great start to point me towards fabricating
        biocompatible microstructures to observe the way the neurons grow and communicate. At
        twenty
        years old I set off to piece together how to create a device that can do just that. 

        In hindsight I realize that much of my journey started off as any other researcher:
        absolute
        perplexity. Given the fact that I was several decades behind current neuroengineering
        methods,
        I had a lot of catching up to do. Eventually I settled on rerunning a couple of old
        experiments on agarose hydrogel. I later figured out that agarose was very
        straightforward
        to
        implement in cell culture systems. Given its thermo-responsive nature, it was also
        relatively
        easy to fabricate and best of all biocompatible. Much of my junior year was studying how
        neurons interacted with agarose. Eventually, I moved on to designing some sort of
        structure
        that can use agarose as a barrier to facilitate confine growth between neuronal
        networks.
        In
        collaboration with another undergraduate (now graduate student), we designed a
        high-throughput
        cell assay that allowed neurons to growth within their own confined curvatures using
        agarose
        hydrogels as a means of fabrication. This was when the project took off and now, six
        months
        later, the results that we obtained describes neuronal communication much better than we
        had
        any right to expect.

        I am very interested in answering three questions in the neuroengineering field. First,
        can
        we
        rationally build a close-loop system that allows us to observe as many stages of the
        cellular
        network as we can? Secondly, how can we holistically quantify perturbations from single
        cell
        or sub-network communication? Thirdly, how can we better communicate our respective
        scientific
        discoveries to scientists of all fields? Since much of my work has been revolved around
        in
        vitro studies, I am curious on how to best translate discoveries between in vitro and in
        vivo.
        Much of these questions revolve around breaking down what we already know about the
        methods
        of
        each respective experimentation. There are several complications that arise from in vivo
        experimentation. There is a limitation on how invasive we want the device to be to study
        brain
        models, additionally there is the challenge of explaining the biological impacts of
        invasive
        methods. Temporally advantageous long term studies also restrict the repetition on how
        many
        times we can conduct the same experiment or if we want to test against a control.
        Remember
        systematic research requires changing only one variable at a time. As a result we see
        that
        in
        vitro studies prove promising in understanding sub-cellular environments of cell growth
        and
        communication. High throughput analysis can be done with rapid repeatability. The
        problem
        is
        translating any of these findings to in vivo models can lead to unreliable conclusions.

    
        Therefore can we design a device that accurately mimics the in vivo environment of the
        human
        brain while simultaneously conducting temporally intensive high throughout experiments
        with
        high repeatability?
    
        Disclosure: Since I have only been conducting neuroengineering research for two years
        much
        of
        my interest could change as I become more exposed to different methods and fields. But
        for now
        this is what I can envision my research going.
